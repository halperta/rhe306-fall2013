##Attendance Policy

You are expected to attend class, to arrive on time, to have prepared assigned reading and writing, and to participate in all in-class editing, revising, and discussion sessions. Should you miss the equivalent of five class sessions, excused or not, you will fail the course. 

This is a departmental policy. See the complete syllabus for a more detailed attendance policy.

##Scholastic Honesty, Plagiarism, and Collusion

Turning in work that is not your own, or any other form of scholastic dishonesty, will result in a major course penalty, possibly failure of the course. This standard applies to all drafts and assignments, and a report of the incident will be submitted to the Office of the Dean of Students and filed in your permanent UT record.
