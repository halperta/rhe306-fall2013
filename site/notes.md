###Tuesday, October 22
* How do you cite a YouTube video in MLA style? Good question. Here's [purdue](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/18/):  

	Author’s Name or Poster’s Username. “Title of Image or Video.” Media Type
	Text. *Name of Website.* Name of Website’s Publisher, date of posting. Medium. date retrieved.

	Here is an example of what that looks like:

	Shimabukuro, Jake. "Ukulele Weeps by Jake Shimabukuro." Online video clip.
	*YouTube.* YouTube, 22 Apr. 2006. Web. 9 Sept. 2010.

	CNN Newsroom. "Obama: Shutdown Completely Unnecessary." Online video clip. *CNN.* CNN, 14 Oct. 2013. Web. 22 Oct. 2013.

###Tuesday, September 17

* There seems to be some confusion about how to use parenthetical citations. According to the MLA, when the author's name appears in the text, you put the page number alone in parentheses before the punctuation (12). If the name does not appear in the text, you include the name and the page number without a comma (MLA 12). Finally, as the website says, "If there's a quotation, put the parentheses outside the quotes" (12). 

###Thursday, September 12  

* If you've forgotten how to produce an MLA citation of an electronic source, you can find the guidelines on the [Purdue OWL Website](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/08/). 
	Here is the Purdue guide to publishing an article in a web magazine:  

	Provide the author name, article name in quotation marks, title of the Web magazine in italics, publisher name, publication date, medium of publication, and the date of access. Remember to use n.p. if no publisher name is available and n.d. if no publishing date is given.  

		Bernstein, Mark. "10 Tips on Writing the Living Web." _A List Apart: For People Who Make Websites._ A List Apart Mag., 16 Aug. 2002. Web. 4 May 2009.

* Here is a guide to citing a newspaper article from Lexis Nexis:  

	Cite a newspaper article as you would a magazine article, but note the different pagination in a newspaper. If there is more than one edition available for that date (as in an early and late edition of a newspaper), identify the edition following the date (e.g., 17 May 1987, late ed.). For an article froma  database, follow the ordinary print citation with the title of the database italicized, the medium of publication, and the date of access.
